      Machine Translation from sanskrit to english:
         Machine translation is the process of translating the source language to the target language performed by a computer.
         The development of the machine translation system for Sanskrit, being an ancient language is a challenging task.
         It proposes to use the Paninian framework and the karaka analysis that is a part of it for the translation
         of sentences and to achieve the translation using a n-grams model trained on the thirukural dataset.
